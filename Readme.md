# Jordan's ENTR Dev Environment



## Quickstart:

1. Dependencies:
    - VSCode
    - VSCode Remote-Containers extension (Available in Extension Marketplace)
2. Check out this repository and open it using VSCode, or by running `git clone ...`
3. Update the submodules using VSCode, or by running `git submodule update`
4. Open the project in the dev container. VSCode may prompt you for this. If it does not, go `CMD-SHIFT-P` and then type `Reopen In Container`.

## Notes:

- You may have to modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to fit your development needs. For example, you can swap the pre-built entralliance image with your own image, or rebuild it from the Dockerfile.
